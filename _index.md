overview: |
  Ubuntu is a popular Debian based Linux distribution, focused on bringing the best of Free Software to the widest audience.

  <p>
    Ubuntu is one of the most popular Linux distributions, derived from Debian and produced by Canonical and friends.
    Canonical runs Ubuntu as an open project to enable others with diverse ideas to benefit from work of Canonical developers,
    and in turn to contribute their volunteer hours to the vital tasks of QA and testing, translation, user support,
    community organizing, in addition to development.
    As a result, Ubuntu is far bigger and more interesting than anything a single company could produce.

  <h3>More on Ubuntu</h3>

  <p>
    Our mission is to bring the best of Free Software to the widest audience.
    Bringing down barriers and empower individuals and communities, to strive on the modern world.
    Free Software and Open Source Software, allows individuals to shape the technology we all use.
  </p>

  <p>
    The ease of use, toughfullness and consideration with which we strive to build Ubuntu, respects the rich cultural
    diversity, and all sorts personal characteristics, and establish rich human connections while we do it.
    The Ubuntu Community is a world wide rich and diverse crowd.
    It's organized around teams, organized by specific types of contributions, geographical locations, native languages,
    preferences of software, etc...
  </p>

  <p>
    Local Communities (LoCo), are one of the most common self-organized community within the broader Ubuntu Community;
    they organize meetups, workshops, parties, conferences, promote Ubuntu within their own cities, regions,
    or even (most often) within their countries.
  </p>

  <p>
    Flavours, remixes, and derivatives are a spectacular way of individuals and/or groups to build upon Ubuntu
    and other projects to augment the technical diversity and freedom of choice within the Ubuntu universe.
  </p>

  <p style="margin-bottom:0;">
    As the Linux and FOSS community in general the Ubunteros, also enjoy many different things,
    like different desktop environments, or just to optimize to specific workloads.
    This is what leads to the creation of flavours such as:&nbsp;
    <ul>
      <li>Kubuntu - with KDE Plasma</li>
      <li>Xubuntu - with XFCE</li>
      <li>Ubuntu Studio - KDE, customed to general studio use</li>
      <li>Lubuntu - with LXQt (formerly LXDE)</li>
      <li>Ubuntu Kylin - with UKUI</li>
      <li>Ubuntu MATE</li>
      <li>Ubuntu Budgie</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p style="margin-bottom:0;">
    But flavors are not the only way to taste the Ubuntu diversity, so we also like to remix:&nbsp;
    <ul>
      <li>Ubuntu Cinnamon (with the Cinnamon Desktop)</li>
      <li>Ubuntu Unity - former default DE of Ubuntu (11.04 to 18.04)</li>
      <li>UbuntuDDE - with the Deepin Desktop Environment</li>
      <li>Ubuntu Web Remix (combines Ubuntu and Firefox)</li>
      <li>UbuntuEd (Ubuntu for Education)</li>
      <li>Retro Home (retro gaming with Ubuntu and Ludo)</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p style="margin-bottom:0;">
    But because Ubuntu is Linux, and the community has such a wonderful vision,
    creativity, and technical ingenuity, there are also derivatives like (but not just):&nbsp;
    <ul>
      <li>Elementary OS</li>
      <li>Regotlith</li>
      <li>Linux Mint</li>
      <li>Ubuntu Touch</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
