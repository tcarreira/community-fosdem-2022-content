description: "
  Ubuntu is one of the most popular Linux distributions, derived from Debian and produced by Canonical and friends.
  Canonical runs Ubuntu as an open project to enable others with diverse ideas to benefit from work of Canonical developers,
  and in turn to contribute their volunteer hours to the vital tasks of QA and testing, translation, user support,
  community organizing, in addition to development.
  As a result, Ubuntu is far bigger and more interesting than anything a single company could produce.
